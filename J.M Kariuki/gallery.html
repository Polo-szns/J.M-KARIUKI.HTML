        <blockquote>
            "Kenya is a country of ten millionaires and ten million beggars." - J.M. Kariuki
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            "I will not keep quiet while the majority suffer and a few enjoy the wealth of this nation."
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            "Every Kenyan man, woman and child is entitled to a decent and just living. That is a birthright. It is not a privilege. He is entitled as far as is humanly possible to equal educational, job and health opportunities irrespective of his parentage, race or creed or his area of origin in this land. If that is so, deliberate efforts should be made to eliminate all obstacles that today stand in the way of this just goal. That is the primary task of the machinery called Government: our Government."
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            "We fought for independence with sweat, blood and our lives. Many of us suffered for inordinate days – directly and indirectly. Many of us are orphans, widows and children as a result of the struggle. We must ask: What did we suffer for, and were we justified in that suffering?"
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            "In Kenya today, I can only see the dawn of a June morning rising majestically from the white oblivion into the serenity of life." – J. M. Kariuki (1974)
