        <p>J.M. Kariuki played a significant role in Kenya’s political landscape, advocating for social justice, equality, and the rights of ordinary citizens.</p>
        <p>After Kenya’s independence in 1963, he became a Member of Parliament and later served as a key advisor to President Jomo Kenyatta. His views often clashed with the government, as he opposed corruption, land injustices, and economic inequality.</p>
        <p>He was a vocal critic of the widening gap between the rich and the poor, famously stating, "Kenya is a country of ten millionaires and ten million beggars." His commitment to the people made him a beloved leader but also led to political tensions.</p>
